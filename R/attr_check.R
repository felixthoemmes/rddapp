#' Attrition Checks
#'
#' \code{attr_check} reports missing data on treatment variable, assignment variable, and outcome.
#' Currently it only supports the design with one assignment variable.
#' This is an internal function and is typically not directly invoked by the user. 
#' It can be accessed using the triple colon, as in rddapp:::attr_check().
#' 
#' @param x1 A numeric object, the assignment variable.
#' @param y A numeric object, the outcome variable, with the same dimensionality 
#'   as \code{x}.
#' @param t A numeric object, the treatment variable, with the same dimensionality 
#'   as \code{x} and \code{y}.
#' @param x2 A numeric object, the secondary assignment variable.
#' 
#' @return A list with the missing data numbers and percentages for all variables 
#'   and subgroups by treatment.
