1) Set your local directory (replace the code for setting up the local directory under Step 1, and run the do files for each of the programs. 

"Simdata" is a program to create simulated data. 
"Trueeffects" is a program to estimate the "true" treatment effects for each of the treatment frontiers, and the average treatment effect. 
"s_mv12" is a program to estimate treatment effects using the frontier approach
"centering" is a program to estimate average treatment effects using the centering approach
"singleav" is a program to estimate frontier treatment effects using the univariate approach
"bwopt" is a program to select bandwidth for non-parametric estimates based on Imbens & Kalyanaraman's (2009) algorithm. 
"IVRD" is an IV approach using the wald estimator. 

(i apologize in advance that the programs may not be the most efficiently programmed ...)

2) Set metric and scale of simulated assignment variables, and the true functional form of the response surface. Run "simdata" program. 

3) Estimate "true" treatment effects for the R and M frontiers, and for the frontier average treatment effect. 

4) Estimate treatment effects using each of the four approaches. 

Finally, I have included the latest draft of the paper which was recently accepted in JEBS. Hopefully, the code that I have provided here will help you write the program to analyze your MRDD. Are you having difficulty with modeling the response function with three assignment variables? I expect that as the number of assignment variables increase, the more difficult it will be to model the correct response surface.
